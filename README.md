# Project Information
This is a game I made using SFML. It is a 2D top-down shooter where you control a box. It is very simple, using simple shapes and colours. I made this when I had a decent amount of knowledge in C++, OOP, and game development. As you may be able to tell, the code is quite messy. I have learned a lot on this project, however. In the future, when I make games like this I am confident that it will be much cleaner.

## To check code
- Go into the "Final Game" folder and take a look at all the .cpp files and .h files.

## To watch gameplay
- 1 minute project demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwNPpsw8rg8

## To run game
- The .exe is found in the "Release" folder.

_Note: running the game will not properly load the fonts and textures. It may also think it's a virus. To see what the game would look like, I recommend watching the video linked above._
